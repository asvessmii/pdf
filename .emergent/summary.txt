<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the project by reviewing the  file, which indicated a clean slate. Following this, the engineer cloned the designated GitHub repository, , into the  directory. A subsequent directory listing provided a clear overview of the existing codebase, identifying core components like , , and . This initial phase was purely focused on environment setup and understanding the existing architecture. No functional changes or feature implementations have commenced yet. The engineer is now ready to proceed with development, having established the foundational understanding of the project.

<product_requirements>
The user requires significant enhancements to an existing Telegram chat bot. The primary objectives are to introduce an admin panel with specific functionalities and to implement a complex timed messaging system.

**Admin Panel Features:**
*   Accessible within the bot via the  command.
*   No web interface required.
*   Admin ID: .
*   Capabilities:
    1.  **Mass Broadcast:** Send a custom message to all bot users.
    2.  **User List:** Display a list of all bot users, including their Telegram usernames.
    3.  **Exit Button:** A dedicated button to exit the admin panel.

**New Timed Messages:**
Three new messages must be added with conditional delivery logic:
*   **For existing users (who used the bot pre-redeploy):** The first new message appears immediately after redeploy, followed by the second and third messages appearing 5 seconds apart.
*   **For new users (who start the bot post-redeploy):** All three new messages appear sequentially, each 5 seconds after the PDF file with diet plan message.

**Message Content and Actions:**
1.  **Message 1:** Text promoting a private chat about a course, keto, etc., with a Зайти! (Join!) button linking to .
2.  **Message 2:** Text about a past webinar, with a Смотреть эфир (Watch webinar) button linking to . (Note: webinar is in a chat requiring prior subscription).
3.  **Message 3:** Detailed course tariff information, appearing *immediately* after the user clicks the Watch webinar button (from Message 2). Includes an Оплатить (Pay) button linking to .

<key_technical_concepts>
- Telegram Bot API: Used for bot interactions and message handling.
- Python: The primary programming language for the bot's backend.
- Git: For repository cloning and version control.
- User State Management: Essential for tracking user interactions and timing messages.
- Database: Likely for storing user data and potentially message history.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a Python-based Telegram bot. The previous engineer cloned the repository and confirmed the following directory structure:



-   ****: This is the main entry point, responsible for bot initialization and update dispatching.
-   ****: Likely contains bot configurations, such as API tokens or admin IDs.
-   ****: Manages database connections and operations, crucial for user data and state.
-   ****: A directory containing modules for different message and command handlers.  will be key for new admin features.  and  will handle new message logic.
-   ****: Defines custom keyboards and inline buttons, essential for the new interactive messages.
-   ****: Likely defines FSM states for managing conversational flows.
-   ****: An existing PDF file, likely the diet plan mentioned in the requirements.
-   ****: An existing image file.

No changes have been applied to these files yet; the current state is post-cloning and initial directory exploration.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Implement admin access and its functionalities (mass broadcast, user listing, exit button).
- Integrate the three new timed messages with their conditional display logic.
- Create and link the Join!, Watch webinar, and Pay inline buttons with their respective URLs.
- Adapt the bot's database logic to track user history for message timing.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has completed the initial setup and environment inspection. The work performed includes:
1.  **Reviewing :** Confirmed that the environment was clean and ready for new work.
2.  **Cloning the Repository:** Successfully cloned  into the  directory.
3.  **Codebase Exploration:** Performed a .

At this point, the environment is prepared, and the existing code structure is understood, but no functional changes have been implemented yet. The bot's core features (admin panel, timed messages) are entirely pending.
